I've only ever gone here for brunch and their portions are definitely big enough to share.  You can add little things (ie: side of peameal), etc.  The food is especially comforting when you have had a hangover the night before...\\n\\nThe decor is A-OK - very average - could probably use some updating.  The waitresses are all very sweet and polite.  Some are more accommodating than others.  One of them had let me upgrade (at an extra cost) from ham to peameal bacon whereas another told me that I had to order a side and I still had to deal with the piece of ham which I didn't end up eating.  \\n\\nGood food - not for everyday but if you want a nice cheap satisfying (high calorie) comforting breakfast.  It's good once in a while definitely and really much better than those main-stream brunch places.\n",

The decor is perfectly dated and the food is classic. All day breakfast for about $10 gets you ample amount of eggs (3!) peameal bacon (3 giant slices) and home fries. I couldn't finish. The coffee is nonstop and the service is fantastic. One of my friends said she's been coming here with her family since she was little. How cute and cozy is that?\n",

I'm all about supporting mom and pop's type businesses and this place is a gem. I love their early bird special. Best bacon out there; ask for extra crispy bacon and it's even better. Their prices are fair, the ambience is cozy and inviting, and the servers are so lovely. I love the servers there! They know my husband and I since we're regulars and they always make a point of saying hello to us. The place is usually busy, so expect to wait for a table, but it's not very long and well worth the wait. Oh, and they have really yummy pancakes and French Toast too!\n",

I had the Harvest breakfast and my girlfriend had the banquet burger. My French toast and sausages were better than ones I would have in other brunch places. My girlfriend usually eats pretty slowly, but she devoured the big burger within minutes, and she wasn't even really hungry. She said the burger could be better than Burger Priest...\\n\\nWe read some poor reviews about their service but I thought it was ok. We like the family ambiance of the place and the more casual service style. It wasn't too slow and the hostess was nice. I definitely would go back and I recommend people not to go for weekend brunches..only because I don't want to wait in line to get a seat...\n",
       "52679    Skip this place!!! Neither the food or the service worth going there.\\n\\nI'll keep it short and straight to the point.  I came for breakfast and ordered the following: Corned beef breakfast with tea, I asked the eggs to be over medium and to substitute home fries with tomatoes. \\n\\nAs soon as I got the plate I noticed that they forgot the tomatoes, so far, not a big deal.  I pointed out the mistake and within a minute or two I got my plate back with 4 slices of tomatoes.  The eggs were over easy and not over medium as I asked, the corned beef was salty, greasy and loaded with sodium, It's one of the rare times were I didn't finished the meat that was on my plate because it tasted so bad.\\n\\nAfter I finished the meal I asked for additional slices of bread, the waitress asked me if I want brown bread like before and I said yes.  the yes didn't seems to matter because I got white bread instead.. I didn't make a big deal out of it because I didn't want to stay there any longer.  \\n\\nWater refill for my tea was given only after asking specifically, they don't seems to walk around often to offer top-up.  At the end I was also charged extra for the tea despite the fact that their menu says \"free coffee and tea with every breakfast\", I asked the waitress why I was changed extra and she replied \"oh, this was an herbal tea it cost extra...\" It wasn't herbal tea it was Earl Grey tea, and last time I checked  Earl Grey  is not herbal but it didn't matter, they charge extra for that!!!\\n\\nAt the end of the day, this is the impression I got:  They can't get orders right, the food is oily and they charge extra for no reason.. \\n\\n I am not going there again!!!\n",

The ambiance is very classy, and so are their foods.  The prices are very reasonable, and the staff are accommodating.  I usually order their Early Bird, or NOT SO early bird breakfast.  Their pancakes are another yummy early bird thing to order.....nonetheless a family dive you can always go to where everybody knows your name...like CHEERS...\n",

There was a line up at the door with a room full of staff but no one acknowledges you at first. After standing there for 10 mins, more people start showing up and finally starts to seat everyone.\\n\\nFirst time at this family restaurant for breakfast. I got the \"early bird\" which came with 3 eggs, sausage or bacon or ham and served with home fries, toast and a coffee. Food was good nothing over the top. Typical breakfast food. Our server was great, very nice and kept checking up on us. They kept up with the coffee refills so that was nice.\n",

Lots of bacon (5 pieces), that was also cooked perfectly. \\nPotatoes were ok, I'd say average. Tasty, but more on the mash / chopped side, which lends itself to be more like mashed. They weren't crispy, but, we're still tasty.\\nCoffee was hot and a bit above average.\\nMy wife commented that the water for her tea was hot, which if you're a tea drinker, you know is essential. Most places it is not hit enough.\\n\\nWill be back.\n",
